	<p id="par1">Akizdenz Grotesk is a notably influential typeface that is still in use over a century after it's creation. Initially used for comercial printing purposes such as for tickets, the typeface features very legible and impactful sans serif letters. It took several decades for this typeface to garner the attention it has today, gaining popularity in the mid 1900s when this typeface was repurposed from generally basic print mediums to use in more artistic and influential designs. Many contemporary typefaces are directly influenced by Akzidenz-Grotesk, for instance Helvetica is nearly identical with only a few changes to certain letters. </p>
